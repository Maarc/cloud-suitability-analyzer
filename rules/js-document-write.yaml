advice:  The use of document.write where native DOM alternatives such as document.createElement are more appropriate. document.write has been grossly misused over the years and has quite a few disadvantages, including that if itâ€™s executed after the page has been loaded, it can actually overwrite the page. Opting for more DOM-friendly methods such as document.createElement is more favourable
